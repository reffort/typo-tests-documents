This directory contains the source files that were used to build
typotests-doc.pdf.  The files are marked up for use with an experimental macro
set that is currently an incomplete work in progress.  The document cannot
be built directly from these files without the macros.

The macros are based on the Scribe document language developed by Brian Reid in
the late 1970s, as documented in the "Scribe Introductory User's Manual"[1] and
in Reid's PhD thesis, "Scribe: A Document Specification Language and its
Compiler"[2].


The files
---------
typodoc.mst : The master file.  Loads all the individual document files in order.

typodoc-style : The style sheet.

typodoc-custom : Some customizations, fancy string formats, etc.

font-libertinus : Mounts the font files and maps the standard character styles
to the corresponding mounted font.

0-frontmatter.mst through 5-references.mst : The source for the document
sections.  The remaining files contain the figures.
