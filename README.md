This repository contains documentation files for using the typographical
modifications to n-t-roff.  These modifications improve the quality of
paragraph-at-once justification and letter adjustment, and allow a great deal
of flexibility and control of paragraph characteristics.

typotests-doc.pdf - A user's manual describing the new features.

troffdemo.pdf - A mildly updated version of Gunnar Ritter's
_Troff Demonstration Page_ that takes advantage of the new paragraphing and
letter adjustment features.

troffdoc.pdf - The _Nroff/Troff User's Manual_ reformatted using the new
paragraphing and letter adjustment features.

The "source" directory contains the source files for the troffdemo.pdf and
troffdoc.pdf.
